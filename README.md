Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
===================================

Linear Congruential Generator

A Pseudo Random Number Generator using the Linear Congruential Generator.

For more about the LCG, you can navigate to:

Another Repository: cprakashagr/LCG-MonteCarlo
has a simulation program which checks the uniformity of the random numbers generated by this program.

For uniformity and the independence check up, below mentioned statistical methods can also be applied.
Chi Square Test, Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) Test,
Auto Corelation Test.
